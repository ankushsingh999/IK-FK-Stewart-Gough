# Forward and Invervse Kinematics of a Stewart Gough Platform Robot

Developed a code for Inverse and Forward Kinematics, with the robot parameters defined in the code, and assuming that the following leg lengths are given for the robot:
𝑙⃗ = [𝑙1, 𝑙2, 𝑙3, 𝑙4, 𝑙5, 𝑙6]𝑇 = [250.1730, 247.7072, 253.3073, 277.6336, 278.4548, 254.3322]𝑇

Feel free to change the parameters and leg lengths in the code as per your requirement. The results below are for the hexapod robot of the configuration I selected.

Calculated the pose (position and orientation) of the top platform, 𝑃⃗⃗ , if 𝛼⃗ = [𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐]𝑇 represents:

**a) ZYZ Euler angles in degrees.**

Execute the code FK1 to obtain the pose when ZYZ euler angles are used.

**b) XYZ Euler angles in degrees.** 

Execute the code FKP2 to obtain the pose when XYZ euler angles are used.
